Notebook descriptions:
- LinearRegressionImpl is an implementation of analytical simple and multiple linear regression.
- GradientDescRegressionImpl is an implementation of linear regression using gradient descent as the minimizing fuction.
- LDA+GibbsImpl is an implementation of collapsed gibbs sampling for latent dirichlet allocation in topic modeling.
